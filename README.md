    ### ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING‚ö†Ô∏è
    1. As of now, Python `v3.10.0` does not support `matplotlib` and error will occur when you try to import `matplotlib.pyplot`. If you're currently using Python `v3.10.0`, I would recommend you to downgrade your Python to version `3.9.8` to make sure no error occured when setting up this repository.

6. numpy
    - `pip install numpy`

I've also used two built-in library in this project which is `math` and `datetime`.
