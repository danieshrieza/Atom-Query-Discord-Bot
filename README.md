As of now, it able to calculate queries from 6 different areas of Mathematics which is :

# Requirement üìù

In order for this Discord Bot to work properly and to avoid error from popping out in the terminal, use `pip` to install the following dependencies :

1. discord.py
    - `pip install discord`

2. discord-slash
    - `pip install discord-py-slash-commands`

3. Fraction
    - `pip install Fraction`

4. itertools
    - `pip install itertools`

5. matplotlib
    - `pip install matplotlib`

    ### ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING‚ö†Ô∏è
    1. As of now, Python `v3.10.0` does not support `matplotlib` and error will occur when you try to import `matplotlib.pyplot`. If you're currently using Python `v3.10.0`, I would recommend you to downgrade your Python to version `3.9.8` to make sure no error occured when setting up this repository.

6. numpy
    - `pip install numpy`

I've also used 4 built-in Python library in this project which is `math`, `datetime`, `os` and `random`.
